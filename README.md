_Oooooooooooooo!_

How to use RTrain

**Add to your `Gemfile`:**
```
gem 'rtrain', '~> 0.1.4'
```

Then `bundle install`

**After generating a scaffold, in your Rails application open up irb in the command line and run the generator:**

```
rails generate rtrain:install
```

**That's it! Now your Rails application is equipped with an RTrain!**
