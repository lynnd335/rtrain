_Oooooooooooooo!_

How to use RTrain

**Put this in your Gemfile**
```
gem 'rtrain', '~> 0.1.4'
```
Then `bundle install`

**After generating a scaffold, in your Rails application open up irb in the command line and run the generator:**

```
rails generate rtrain:install
```
**That's it! Now your Rails application is equipped with an RTrain!**
