How to use RTrain

**Put this in your Gemfile**
```
gem 'rtrain', '~> 0.1.6'
```
Then `bundle install`

**After generating a scaffold, enter any of these into the command line:**

```
rails generate rtrain:install --copy_css
```

_Oooooooooooooo!_

Turns your basic scaffold into something that's at least tolerable to look at!

**New! Add a sweet nav bar!**
```
rails generate rtrain:install --copy_css
```

**That's it! Now your Rails application is equipped with an RTrain!**
